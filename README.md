# CS 320 Module 8 Journal

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
I can make sure my code works and stays safe by checking the information coming into my program, keeping my tools and software up to date, carefully testing my code, protecting user information using controls and passwords, staying aware of new security problems, and asking others for feedback to catch problems early.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
I can understand what users want and put it into my program by talking to them to learn their needs, making profiles of different types of users, making plans for how the program will look, working with others like users and designers, starting with the most important features, and making improvements based on feedback from users.

**How do I approach designing software?**
When I design software, I first study what it needs to do and what users want from it. Then, I plan how the software will work in general and make detailed plans for how each part should look and behave. I might draw pictures or models to test out ideas. After that, I write the actual code carefully, testing everything to find and fix problems. I also write down instructions on how to use the software. Finally, I keep checking and improving the software over time.
